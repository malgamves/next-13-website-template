# Next 13 Tailwind template 

This is a stand alone Next 13 template with pre-made components that use [Tailwind CSS](tailwindcss.com/). I use this template in my updated [egghead course](). The template comes with the following components:

- Back
- Centered
- Content
- Description
- Hello
- LeftDescription
- LeftGrid
- List
- Main
- PageContainer
- Pagination
- PostsContainer
- PostsMain
- RightGrid
- Title

To see the components in the wild, check out a [website](https://modern-cms-prod.vercel.app/) I built with it. 


### Running the template

In your terminal, run the cammand below to start your development server.
```
yarn dev
```

To use the components, open `app/page.js` or any other page file you want to use them in, [import them](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/importing-a-component/) and voila âœ¨
